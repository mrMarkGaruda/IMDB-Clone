## üèóÔ∏è Part 1: Database Schema & Performance Design

### **Database Schema Design**

Our schema is optimized for both storage efficiency and query performance:

```sql
-- Core Tables with Performance Indexes
title_basics (tconst PK, titleType, primaryTitle, startYear, genres, isAdult)
name_basics (nconst PK, primaryName, birthYear, primaryProfession)
title_ratings (tconst PK‚Üítitle_basics, averageRating, numVotes)
title_principals (tconst‚Üítitle_basics, nconst‚Üíname_basics, category, ordering)
title_crew (tconst PK‚Üítitle_basics, directors, writers)
title_episode (tconst PK, parentTconst‚Üítitle_basics, seasonNumber)
title_akas (titleId‚Üítitle_basics, title, region, language)
```

### **Strategic Indexing for Performance**

```sql
-- Primary performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_title_type ON title_basics(titleType);          -- Fast type filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_title_year ON title_basics(startYear);          -- Year-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_title_genre ON title_basics(genres);            -- Genre searches
CREATE INDEX idx_ratings_rating ON title_ratings(averageRating); -- Rating filters
CREATE INDEX idx_principals_category ON title_principals(category); -- Role-based queries

-- Composite indexes for complex queries
CREATE INDEX idx_title_basics_composite ON title_basics(titleType, startYear, isAdult);
CREATE INDEX idx_title_ratings_composite ON title_ratings(averageRating, numVotes);
```

**Why This Design Works:**
- **Normalized Structure**: Eliminates data redundancy while maintaining query performance
- **Strategic Denormalization**: `title_crew` stores comma-separated values for faster director/writer lookups
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex WHERE clauses
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures data integrity across relationships

## üåê Part 2: Web Application Queries (< 1 Second Execution)

### **Query 1: Movie Summary Page**

```sql
-- Purpose: Display movie overview with cast, crew, and ratings
-- Performance Target: < 100ms
-- Strategy: Uses primary key lookups and limited JOINs

SELECT 
    tb.tconst,
    tb.primaryTitle,
    tb.startYear,
    tb.runtimeMinutes,
    tb.genres,
    tr.averageRating,
    tr.numVotes,
    tc.directors,
    tc.writers,
    GROUP_CONCAT(nb.primaryName, ', ') as main_cast
FROM title_basics tb
LEFT JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst           -- Index: PK lookup
LEFT JOIN title_crew tc ON tb.tconst = tc.tconst              -- Index: PK lookup  
LEFT JOIN title_principals tp ON tb.tconst = tp.tconst        -- Index: FK + ordering
    AND tp.ordering <= 5                                       -- Limit to top 5 cast
LEFT JOIN name_basics nb ON tp.nconst = nb.nconst             -- Index: PK lookup
WHERE tb.tconst = ? AND tb.titleType = 'movie'                -- Index: PK + type
GROUP BY tb.tconst
```

**Performance Analysis:**
- **Primary Key Lookups**: Fastest possible access pattern
- **Limited JOINs**: Only essential data to minimize processing
- **Ordering Filter**: `tp.ordering <= 5` reduces join complexity
- **Expected Execution Time**: 50-100ms

### **Query 2: Advanced Search with Filters**

```sql
-- Purpose: Multi-criteria search with pagination
-- Performance Target: < 500ms
-- Strategy: Uses multiple indexes and optimized WHERE clauses

SELECT 
    tb.tconst,
    tb.primaryTitle,
    tb.startYear,
    tb.runtimeMinutes,
    tb.genres,
    tr.averageRating,
    tr.numVotes
FROM title_basics tb
LEFT JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst
WHERE tb.titleType = 'movie'                    -- Index: idx_title_type
    AND (? IS NULL OR tb.startYear >= ?)        -- Index: idx_title_year
    AND (? IS NULL OR tb.startYear <= ?)        -- Index: idx_title_year
    AND (? IS NULL OR tb.genres LIKE '%' || ? || '%')  -- Index: idx_title_genre
    AND (? IS NULL OR tr.averageRating >= ?)    -- Index: idx_ratings_rating
    AND (? IS NULL OR tb.isAdult = ?)           -- Index: idx_title_adult
ORDER BY tr.numVotes DESC, tr.averageRating DESC
LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Conditional Filters**: `? IS NULL OR` pattern allows optional filters
- **Index Coverage**: Each WHERE condition uses a dedicated index
- **Optimized ORDER BY**: Uses most selective columns first
- **Pagination**: LIMIT/OFFSET for memory efficiency

### **Query 3: TV Series with Episode Count**

```sql
-- Purpose: TV series overview with season/episode statistics
-- Performance Target: < 200ms
-- Strategy: Aggregation with pre-computed joins

SELECT 
    tb.tconst,
    tb.primaryTitle,
    tb.startYear,
    tb.endYear,
    tb.genres,
    tr.averageRating,
    tr.numVotes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT te.seasonNumber) as season_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT te.tconst) as episode_count
FROM title_basics tb
LEFT JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst
LEFT JOIN title_episode te ON tb.tconst = te.parentTconst      -- Index: idx_episode_parent
WHERE tb.tconst = ? AND tb.titleType = 'tvSeries'
GROUP BY tb.tconst
```

**Why This Is Fast:**
- **Parent-Child Index**: `idx_episode_parent` optimizes episode lookups
- **Selective Grouping**: Groups only on the target series
- **COUNT DISTINCT**: Efficient aggregation for statistics

### **Query 4: Person Filmography**

```sql
-- Purpose: Complete career overview for actors/directors
-- Performance Target: < 300ms
-- Strategy: Person-centric joins with role categorization

SELECT 
    tb.tconst,
    tb.primaryTitle,
    tb.titleType,
    tb.startYear,
    tp.category,
    tp.characters,
    tr.averageRating
FROM title_principals tp
JOIN title_basics tb ON tp.tconst = tb.tconst                  -- Index: FK relationship
LEFT JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst           -- Index: PK lookup
WHERE tp.nconst = ?                                            -- Index: person lookup
ORDER BY tb.startYear DESC, tr.averageRating DESC
```

**Performance Features:**
- **Person-First Approach**: Starts with the person's records
- **Chronological Ordering**: Most recent work first
- **Rating Priority**: Higher-rated work appears earlier

### **Query 5: Fast Text Search**

```sql
-- Purpose: Full-text search with relevance ranking
-- Performance Target: < 200ms
-- Strategy: LIKE optimization with relevance scoring

SELECT 
    tb.tconst,
    tb.primaryTitle,
    tb.titleType,
    tb.startYear,
    tr.averageRating,
    tr.numVotes
FROM title_basics tb
LEFT JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst
WHERE tb.primaryTitle LIKE ? OR tb.originalTitle LIKE ?        -- Index: title indexes
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN tb.primaryTitle LIKE ? THEN 1    -- Exact matches first
        WHEN tb.primaryTitle LIKE ? THEN 2    -- Prefix matches second
        ELSE 3                                -- Partial matches last
    END,
    tr.numVotes DESC                          -- Popularity tiebreaker
LIMIT 50
```

**Search Optimization:**
- **Relevance Ranking**: Exact matches prioritized over partial
- **Popularity Tiebreaker**: Most voted titles appear first
- **Limited Results**: LIMIT prevents overwhelming responses

        PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (
            ORDER BY tr.averageRating
        ) as top_10_percent_rating
    FROM title_basics tb
    JOIN title_ratings tr ON tb.tconst = tr.tconst,
    -- Genre splitting (simplified for SQLite)
    (SELECT 'Drama' as genre_value UNION SELECT 'Comedy' UNION SELECT 'Action') genres
    WHERE tb.titleType = 'movie' 
        AND tb.genres LIKE '%' || genres.genre_value || '%'
        AND tr.numVotes >= 50
    GROUP BY genre
    HAVING total_movies >= 100                                  -- HAVING clause!
)
SELECT 
    genre,
    total_movies,
    avg_rating,
    median_rating,
    top_10_percent_rating,
    total_votes,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY avg_rating DESC) as quality_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_movies DESC) as popularity_rank,
    CASE 
        WHEN avg_rating > 7.0 AND total_movies > 1000 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN avg_rating > 6.0 AND total_movies > 500 THEN 'Popular'
        ELSE 'Niche'
    END as genre_category
FROM genre_stats

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Strategies

### **1. Index Strategy**
```sql
-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_movie_search ON title_basics(titleType, startYear, isAdult, genres);
CREATE INDEX idx_rating_filter ON title_ratings(averageRating, numVotes);
CREATE INDEX idx_person_role ON title_principals(nconst, category, ordering);
```

### **2. Query Optimization Techniques**

**Selective WHERE Clauses:**
- Place most selective conditions first
- Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries
- Avoid functions in WHERE clauses

**JOIN Optimization:**
- Use INNER JOIN when possible (faster than LEFT JOIN)
- Join on indexed columns
- Consider join order for performance

**Aggregation Efficiency:**
- Use GROUP BY with indexed columns
- Leverage HAVING for post-aggregation filtering
- Consider pre-computed summaries for repeated calculations

### **3. Data Loading Strategy**
```python
# Chunked loading for memory efficiency
chunk_size = 10000
for chunk in pd.read_csv(file, chunksize=chunk_size):
    chunk.to_sql(table_name, conn, if_exists='append', index=False)
```
